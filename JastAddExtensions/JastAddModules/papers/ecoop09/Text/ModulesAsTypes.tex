%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

We propose that the limitations of existing systems detailed in the previous section
can be solved by defining object-oriented relationships and operations on modules. 
We consider a module as a collection of classes, and it acts as the encapsulation
structure for the collection. We then proceed to define
relations and operations on modules and, in a later section, show how
these model current module usage. Due to lack of space, the full grammar for
the module system is not included in the paper, and can be found at
\textit{http://progtools.comlab.ox.ac.uk/members/neil}.

Most of the examples in this section are abridged versions taken from the JHotdraw case study. 
JHotdraw\cite{jhotdraw} is a small framework for drawing applications. It
uses the \textit{net.n3.nanoxml} library for xml parsing, and part of 
\textit{org.apache.batik} for scalable vector graphics support. It also
provides a set of sample applications that demonstrate use of the framework.
Handling JHotdraw's dependencies on the two libraries as well as the dependencies
of the sample applications on JHotdraw and each other provide a small but
suitable testbed to evaluate the usefulness of the module system.
The case study is available at \textit{http://progtools.comlab.ox.ac.uk/members/neil}. 

\subsection{Declaration and Membership}

First we define how modules and module membership are declared. 
Modules are declared in a {\tt .module} file that begins with a module
declaration:

\begin{lstlisting}
//File org.jhotdraw.module
module org.jhotdraw; ...
\end{lstlisting}

Class membership is declared by having a module declaration at the compilation unit where 
the class appears.  If a package declaration is present, 
the package name is used as the package name of the class within the module.

\begin{lstlisting}
//File Gradient.java
module org.jhotdraw; //membership in module org.jhotdraw
package org.jhotdraw.samples.svg;
public interface Gradient extends Cloneable { ... }
\end{lstlisting}

Module membership can also be declared over an entire package. Package membership in a module 
is declared by having a module declaration
in the \textit{package-info.java} file of that package.

\begin{lstlisting}
//File org/jhotdraw/app/action/package-info.java
//all classes in package org.jhotdraw.app.action also belong to module org.jhotdraw
module org.jhotdraw;
package org.jhotdraw.app.action;
\end{lstlisting}

If the module declaration specified in a compilation unit's \textit{package-info.java}
file is in conflict with that specified in the file itself, the membership
declared in the file takes precedence, but a warning is issued.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\subsection{Imports}

For a module to be able to access classes in another module,
it must first import an instance of that module. This way, imports form
a hard constraint on the visibility of classes.

There are two ways to import a module. The first is to import the singleton
instance of the module. This is done in the following manner:

\begin{lstlisting}
//imports the singleton instance
import org.jhotdraw;
\end{lstlisting}

Importing the singleton instance of a module allows you to share the classes
of that module with other modules that also import it.

Similar to iJAM \cite{iJAM}, a module may also import its \textbf{own} instance of
a module. It is also allowed to rename that instance to allow for multiple
instances of the same module to exist in the same context.

\begin{lstlisting}
//imports an own instance
import own org.jhotdraw;
//imports on own instance with an alias
import own org.jhotdraw as jhotdraw;
\end{lstlisting}

Unlike iJAM, renaming an instance does not implicitly allow other
modules to access that instance. To allow access to other modules, the import
must be exported:

\begin{lstlisting}
//imports an own instance, and makes it available to other modules
import own org.jhotdraw export as jhotdraw;
\end{lstlisting}

The visibility of the module instances become important for module
qualified name lookups and the merge and replace operations described in later
sections.

An import declaration creates a typed module reference that points to the module
instance specified. The type of the reference created is the module
in the import declaration. The module reference can later be pointed to another
instance using the operations \textbf{replace} and \textbf{merge} described
in the following sections.

Import cycles involving \textbf{own} instances are not allowed, as this would 
cause an infinite loop of module instantiation. Import cycles involving only
singleton modules, however, are allowed.

\subsection{Exported packages}

We allow exported packages similar to {\tt export-package} in OSGi bundles. Unlike OSGi, however,
exporting a package does not automatically allow other modules to gain
access to these packages. A module \textit{A} must first import another module \textit{B}
before gaining access to \textit{B}'s exported packages.

Exported packages are declared in the {\tt .module} file:

\begin{lstlisting}
module org.jhotdraw.batikfragment;
//allow other modules access to types in these packages
export package 
	org.apache.batik.ext.awt.image,	org.apache.batik.ext.awt,	org.apache.batik;
\end{lstlisting}

You may also export all the packages that belong to a module by using
the * wildcard. This is the only way to export classes that belong to
the default package in a module.

\begin{lstlisting}
module org.jhotdraw;
//export all packages
export package *;
\end{lstlisting}

%We also allow the \textbf{module} access modifier proposed for JSR294 \cite{JSR294}
%which applies to classes, fields and methods. Module private access only allows
%accesses from classes that belong to the same module.

%\begin{lstlisting}
%module org.x.y; //module membership
%module class C { //only visible in org.x.y
%	public void publicMethod() {...};
%	module void moduleMethod() {...}; //same here
%}
%\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Module Qualified Type References}

Type references can now be qualified with module names to explicitly
identify the module that contains the class. Module qualifiers
are separated from package and type names by the \textit{::} separator,
and also allows for indirection. For example, given the following module:

\begin{lstlisting}
module org.jhotdraw;
import own net.n3.nanoxml export as nanoxml;
import own org.apache.batik export as batik;
export package *;
\end{lstlisting}

The class \textit{org.jhotdraw.Version} in the module \textit{org.jhotdraw}
can be accessed as
\begin{lstlisting}
org.jhotdraw::org.jhotdraw.Version
\end{lstlisting}
Classes in \textit{nanoxml} and \textit{batik} can be accessed by indirection:
\begin{lstlisting}
org.jhotdraw::nanoxml::net.n3.nanoxml.Version
org.jhotdraw::batik::org.apache.batik.Version
\end{lstlisting}

In the following example, a sample application \textit{org.jhotdraw.samples.simple}
uses the Jhotdraw framework by importing its own instance of the module
\textit{org.jhotdraw}. The module \textit{org.jhotdraw} itself uses the 
two libraries \textit{net.n3.nanoxml} and \textit{org.apache.batik}, and
exports them so that other modules can also access their classes. The 
application then gets the versions of JHotdraw and its dependencies.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Module Qualified Type References,numbers=left]
//File org.jhotdraw.module
module org.jhotdraw;
import own net.n3.nanoxml export as nanoxml;
import own org.apache.batik export as batik;
export package *;

//File org.apache.batik.module
module org.apache.batik;
export package 
	org.apache.batik.ext.awt.image,	org.apache.batik.ext.awt,	org.apache.batik;

//File net.n3.nanoxml
module net.n3.nanoxml;
export package net.n3.nanoxml;

//File org.jhotdraw.samples.simple.module
module org.jhotdraw.samples.simple;
//import own instance of jhotdraw
import own org.jhotdraw export as jhotdraw;
export package *;

//File Main.java
module org.jhotdraw.samples.simple;
package org.jhotdraw.samples.simple;
//on-demand import of indirect import batik
import jhotdraw::batik::org.apache.batik.*;
public class Main {
	//direct imports don't need a qualifier
	String jhotdrawVersion = org.jhotdraw.Version.version;
	//module qualified type name
	String nanoXMLVersion = jhotdraw::nanoxml::net.n3.nanoxml.Version.version;
	//from the on-demand import
	String batikVersion = Version.version;
}
\end{lstlisting}

The class \textit{org.jhotdraw.Version} can be accessed without
a module qualifier since it is a member of the JHotdraw module, 
which is directly imported by the application Simple. To access
the versions of JHotdraw's dependencies, the type names have to
be qualified with the module qualifier that denotes their parent
module. As \textit{net.n3.nanoxml.Version} is not a direct import,
it needs to be qualified with \textit{jhotdraw::nanoxml::}, which
points to the \textit{nanoxml} import of JHotdraw. The same is
true for \textit{org.apache.batik.Version}, and as the example shows,
the module qualified names can also be used in import declarations.

Module qualifiers allow a developer to explicitly define from which module
to load the class. This enables the disambiguation of ambiguous type
lookups caused by a module importing two different versions of the same module, or
by split packages (i.e. a package that occurs in more than one of the imported modules).

The module qualifiers are relative and are looked up in the context 
of the module that contains them. This removes the need for globally
unique names which would have been difficult if not impossible in the
presence of \textbf{own} module instances. Also, a module can only
access a module reference of its imported module if the imported module
exported that reference. This allows a module to hide dependencies from
its clients. This becomes useful when module interfaces are introduced
in a later section.

Types that do not belong to a module are considered to be members of
the ``default'' module. This module has a blank name, and its singleton
instance is implicitly imported by all modules. So, a module-less
type {\tt javax.swing.Action} can be accessed in this way:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Default Module Lookups]
module somemodule;
package mypackage;
//import from the default module
import ::javax.swing.Action;
class MyClass {	Action a = new Action(){...}; }
\end{lstlisting}

One can still use ordinary \textit{packagename.TypeName} accesses to types in
the default module, as long as there are no classes in the current module
or its imported modules that have the same package and type name. However,
if these do exist, it is necessary to use the module qualified name to access
these classes to avoid an ambiguous type error.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
\subsection{Submodules}

Current module systems have limited means of changing a module's behavior through
extension. We now define a module extension through a submodule to address this limitation. 
A module is declared to be the submodule of another module by using the \textbf{extends} keyword:

\begin{lstlisting}
module defaultsample.defaultjhotdraw extends org.jhotdraw;
\end{lstlisting}

A submodule inherits all the import declarations and export package declarations 
of its parent module, and can add some more of its own. It also inherits the member 
compilation units (and the types therein) of its supermodule.

If a submodule contains a type with the identical package and type name
to another type which is a member of its supermodule, 
this shadows the type in the supermodule for all type references that
originate from the submodule, and any other modules that import an
instance of the submodule.

Instantiating a submodule creates a name-mangled instance of the module's supermodules,
which are searched when an access to a member type of a submodule is attempted. These
supermodule instances are unique to the submodule instance and can only be accessed
through the submodule. This is true even for singleton modules.

The following example demonstrates submodules and shadowing. The module
\textit{defaultsample.defaultjhotdraw} extends the module \textit{org.jhotdraw}. 
It also contains the class \textit{org.jhotdraw.app.action.AboutAction},
which overrides a class with the same package and name in the supermodule.
The new \textit{AboutAction} extends the version in the supermodule and
changes the message of the about dialog.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Module Subtyping]
//file defaultsample.defaultjhotdraw.module 
module defaultsample.defaultjhotdraw extends org.jhotdraw;
//the batik and nanoxml imports are inherited from org.jhotdraw
export package *;

//file org/jhotdraw/app/action/AboutAction.java
module org.jhotdraw;
package org.jhotdraw.app.action;
//this class will be overridden
public class AboutAction extends AbstractApplicationAction {
	public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt) {
		JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(...);
	}
}

//file defaultjhotdraw/app/action/AboutAction.java
module defaultsample.defaultjhotdraw;
package org.jhotdraw.app.action;
import batik::org.apache.batik.Version;
//This class shadows the class org.jhotdraw::org.jhotdraw.app.action.AboutAction
public class AboutAction extends supermodule::org.jhotdraw.app.action.AboutAction {
	public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt) {
		//add batik version to about message
		JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(...	+ "Batik version " + Version.version,	...);
	}
}

\end{lstlisting}

As the example shows, the overriding \textit{AboutAction} class extends the
overridden class in the supermodule by using the special 
\textit{supermodule::} module qualifier to access the overridden class. It
then redefines the only method required to change the behavior as required.
All lookups for the class \textit{AboutAction} now resolve to the overriding
class, including those in the classes that belong to the supermodule.

Without submodules, changing \textit{AboutAction} without access to the source
would require extending the class and reimplementing the method 
that instantiates it. Module extension allows the same extension without
any reimplementation except for the code that actually changes the behavior of the overridden class.
Module extension can be used as an alternative to existing OO extension patterns when they
are not explicitly supported. 

Overriding classes in submodules, as a general rule, should only change the implementation 
of a class, not its interface. As an example, overriding an abstract class in a submodule by adding
a new abstract method will cause all existing classes that are subtypes of the 
abstract class to break, even the ones that are in the supermodule. This is not always
the case however: for example, one can override an abstract class and change its interface
as long as one is sure to also override all subtypes of that class, and that the
abstract class is not used outside the module. For this reason no constraints are checked
on the structure of the overriding class in the submodule.

Submodules can also be used to patch an existing module without
destructive modification. Patching is done by creating a submodule
and overriding the classes that require modification. The submodule can
then be used instead of the original module, while also allowing the
unpatched module to exist in its original state.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\subsection{Overrides}

Submodules allow extension or patching of a module without actually
rebuilding a completely new module. However, it does have the disadvantage
of being dependent on the existence of its supermodules. To get
around this limitation, we define the \textbf{overrides} relation to allow
a module to completely replace another module. A module is declared
to override another using the \textbf{overrides} keyword:

\begin{lstlisting}
module org.apache.batik1_8pre overrides org.apache.batik1_6, org.apache.batik1_7;
\end{lstlisting}

Unlike submodules, an overriding module does not inherit anything from the
modules it overrides, and does not even need any of the overriden modules to
be present in the compile. However, it \textit{must} provide the same exported modules
and packages as its overridden modules to satisfy the external and internal
clients of these modules. 

As is expected, override is inherited by submodules. This allows a submodule
of an overriding module to override the same modules as its supermodule.

Declaring an overriding module does not automatically change over all references
to the overridden module to use the overriding module. This is done using the
\textbf{replace} operation described in the section below, which also contains
an example of the use of \textbf{overrides}.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\subsection{Replace}

One of the common operations on modules is replacing an older version of a
dependency with a newer one. Since the proposed module system allows for instances
of a module that are local to its client, we define an operation \textbf{replace} which
changes the target of a list of module references in the context of a module:

\begin{lstlisting}
replace m1, m2::m3, m4, ... with <moduleexpr>;
\end{lstlisting}

The replace operation changes a list of module references to point to an instance
defined by a module expression. A module expression may be a module reference to
an existing instance, a reference to the singleton instance of a module, or
a new \textbf{own} instance of a module.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Module Expressions for Replace]
//replace with an existing reference
import own org.apache.batik1_6 as mybatik;
replace jhotdraw::batik with mybatik;
//replace with a the singleton instance
replace jhotdraw::batik with singleton org.apache.batik1_6;
//replace with a new instance of a module
replace jhotdraw::batik with own org.apache.batik1_6;
\end{lstlisting}

A module reference can be replaced with a module expression if its type
is the same, is a supermodule or is overridden by the module expression.

Replace declarations are also inherited by submodules. The replace sequence for a
module is given by a list of its supermodule's replaces, starting from the farthest
ancestor. There is no way to exclude a supermodule's replaces, as
this may reduce the module signature (the set of module references available) of
the supermodule, which could cause the internal and external clients of
the supermodule to break.

It should be noted that an instance created using the \textbf{own} module expression in 
a replace declaration is not
implicitly imported by the module to which the replace declaration belongs (that is, the member
classes of the module containing the replace declaration do not have direct access to the
classes in the instance created by the own expression). This
is useful when updating the dependencies of an import when the module itself
does not require the same dependency.

The following example taken from the JHotdraw case study shows how replace can
be used to update a dependency to a more recent version. The example contains
the sample JHotdraw applications \textit{samples.net} and \textit{samples.netold}, 
where \textit{samples.net} is a newer version of the other application. They both 
derive from \textit{samples.defaultsample}, which imports \textit{defaultsample.defaultjhotdraw} 
from the extends example in the previous section. The sample \textit{netold} updates 
the \textit{batik} dependency of \textit{jhotdraw} to the 1.7 version of batik.
The newer \textit{net} then re-updates the same dependency to the 1.8pre version of batik.
It should be noted that in this compile, the 1.7 version of batik does not exist, and
is expected to be replaced by the 1.8pre version.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Replace]
//file net.n3.nanoxmlv2_2_1_4patch.module
module net.n3.nanoxmlv2_2_1_4patch extends net.n3.nanoxml;

//file org.apache.batik1_6.module
module org.apache.batik1_6;
...

//file org.apache.batik1_8pre.module
module org.apache.batik1_8pre overrides org.apache.batik1_6, org.apache.batik1_7;
...

//file org.jhotdraw.module
module org.jhotdraw;
import own org.apache.batik1_6 export as batik;
...

//file samples.defaultsample.module
module samples.defaultsample;
import own defaultsample.defaultjhotdraw export as jhotdraw;
//replace nanoxml with a patched version
replace jhotdraw::nanoxml with own net.n3.nanoxmlv2_2_1_4patch;
export package *;

//file samples.netold.module
module samples.netold extends samples.defaultsample;
//update to batik version 1.7, which is not in the build
replace jhotdraw::batik with own org.apache.batik1_7;

//file samples.net.module
module samples.net extends samples.netold;
//update to batik version 1.8
replace jhotdraw::batik	with own org.apache.batik1_8pre;
\end{lstlisting}

The example shows how a submodule can replace a supermodule
reference, and how an overriding module can replace a overridden module
that is not part of the build.

In addition to the type rules for replace, it is also not allowed to 
replace a module reference that points to a singleton module or
is or at any point indirects through a singleton module. This is to ensure that other
modules that depend on the singleton instance can correctly keep their
assumptions about the unmodified state of the singleton.

%Merge and replace make different modules sure to use the same
%set of classes (avoids nondeterministic class loading). Also, can
%be used to update modules to use newer versions of their imported
%modules. They can also be used to access the namespace of indirect imports
%without qualifiers by merging the indirect imports with a directly
%imported instance of that module.


%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\subsection{Merge}

It is often necessary to make sure that two or more modules use the same
instance of a dependency, to ensure that these
modules are able to share types. Furthermore, it should be possible for
the importers of a module to easily maintain this condition on a module's
instance. For this, we define the \textbf{merge} operation.

\begin{lstlisting}
merge m1,m2::m3,m4 [export] as mtype alias;
\end{lstlisting}

Similar to an \textbf{own} import declaration, a merge declaration creates
a module reference named \textit{alias} with type \textit{mtype},
points this to a \textbf{own} instance of type \textit{mtype}, and then replaces all
the module references in the list with the newly created instance. Furthermore,
any further replaces that target \textit{alias} will also update all
the references in the list. This also works recursively: if \textit{alias}
is targeted by another merge 
\begin{lstlisting}
merge alias, anotheralias export as m1 newmerge;
\end{lstlisting}
then any replace that targets \textit{newmerge} also update the references
in the merge declaration of \textit{alias}.

The merge operation requires that the type of the created reference be 
replace-compatible with all the references in the merge list, as the instance will
have to be assigned to each of the references. Similar to replaces, merges 
are also implicitly inherited by submodules.

The following example taken from the JHotdraw case study shows \textbf{merge}
can be used to make sure that common dependencies between an importer and
an imported module can be made to point to the same module instance. The
application \textit{samples.svg} imports the jhotdraw framework through
its supermodule \textit{samples.defaultsample}, and then merges
its own \textit{batik} dependency with that of the imported \textit{jhotdraw}.
Another application \textit{samples.odg} imports \textit{samples.svg}, 
and then merges its own instance of jhotdraw with that of the SVG application, 
while also updating the import's \textit{batik} dependency with a newer version.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Merge]
//file org.jhotdraw.module
module org.jhotdraw;
import own org.apache.batik export as batik;
...

//file samples.svg.module
module samples.svg extends samples.defaultsample;
import own org.apache.batik1_6 export as batik;
...
//merge this module's batik import with
//that of the imported jhotdraw's
merge jhotdraw::batik, batik export as org.apache.batik1_6 batik;
...

//file samples.odg.module
module samples.odg extends samples.defaultsample;
import own samples.svg as svg;
...
//merge this module's jhotdraw with svg's
//jhotdraw
merge svg::jhotdraw, jhotdraw export as defaultsample.defaultjhotdraw jhotdraw;
//replace svg's batik with a new version
//this also updates jhotdraw's batik through
//the merge declaration in svg
replace svg::batik with own org.apache.batik1_8pre;
\end{lstlisting}


The merge in line 12 allows the clients of \textit{samples.svg}
the ability to update all of its \textit{batik} dependencies
in a single replace declaration, as the \textit{samples.odg}
application does in line 25. Similarly, the \textit{samples.odg} application
uses merge in for the same purpose in line 21, allowing any importers
to merge its own \textit{jhotdraw} import with that of \textit{samples.odg}.
The recursive nature of merge allows replaces to propagate through deep
import graphs of real applications. 

Without the merge, \textit{samples.odg} would have been forced to perform 
replace both references to the \textit{batik} dependency
in JHotdraw and the SVG sample, a system that would be infeasible in larger projects
with more shared dependencies.

Once merged, a module reference can no longer be used in another merge. This
enforces the constraint that all the modules in the merge list point to the
same instance. Replace is still allowed to target the individual 
references in the merge, possibly pointing it to an instance different from
the other references. This is not advised, however, and will cause a warning to be
issued.

\subsection{Module Interfaces}

Extending the object-oriented metaphor, with modules being classes, we 
now define \textit{module interfaces}, which act similarly to interfaces in Java. A module
interface contains no imports, replaces, merges or even member classes, but they
are allowed to have a set of export package declarations. A module implementing
a module interface must contain and export the packages specified in the interface.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Module Interfaces]
//file org.apache.batik.module
module_interface org.apache.batik;
export package 
	org.apache.batik.ext.awt.image,	org.apache.batik.ext.awt,	org.apache.batik;

//file org.jhotdraw.batikfragment.module
//this implements the interface above
module org.jhotdraw.batikfragment 
	implements org.apache.batik;
export package 
	org.apache.batik.ext.awt.image,	org.apache.batik.ext.awt,	org.apache.batik;

//file org.jhotdraw.module
module org.jhotdraw;
//import the interface instead of the module itself
import own org.apache.batik export as batik;
...
//replace the interface with an instance of
//the implementing module
replace batik with own org.jhotdraw.batikfragment; 
\end{lstlisting}

Rules for module interface subtyping are similar to those of interfaces in Java:
interfaces can only extend interfaces, and they can not implement other
interfaces. 

Since interfaces do not actually contain any classes, they must be replaced
by a non-interface module when compiling a fully working system. This would
have to be relaxed for separate compilation of modules that reference interfaces
to be possible, and this is expounded a bit more in section \ref{eval}.

\subsection{Weak Module Interfaces}

It may be the case that an application developer knows the packages that
he wishes to use, but the provider of the module that contains these packages 
did not define a module interface that specifically contains those packages. For
this case, we define a \textit{weak module interface}. Weak module interfaces act similarly
to normal module interfaces, except that it is also implicitly implemented
by all modules that satisfy its export package signature \cite{mcdirmid01jiazzi, componentnextgen}, 
even if these modules did not explicitly declare that they implemented the interface.

The interface in the example above can be weakened, which allows the use
of the \textit{batik} libraries without them explicitly implementing the interface.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Weak Interfaces]
//file org.apache.batik.module
weak_module_interface org.apache.batik;
export package 
	org.apache.batik.ext.awt.image,	org.apache.batik.ext.awt,	org.apache.batik;

//file org.jhotdraw.batikfragment.module
//no longer explicitly implements the interface
module org.jhotdraw.batikfragment;
export package 
	org.apache.batik.ext.awt.image,	org.apache.batik.ext.awt, org.apache.batik;
	
//file org.jhotdraw.module
module org.jhotdraw;
//import the weak interface 
import own org.apache.batik export as batik;
...
//replace the interface with an instance module
replace batik with own org.jhotdraw.batikfragment; 
\end{lstlisting}

%Type lookup subsection, excised for lack of space
%\input{Text/TypeLookupSubSection}

%section on constraints, now part of the indivudual sections where they apply
%\SubSection{Constraints on Modules}

%Cycles involving \textit{import own} are not allowed, as this leads to an infinite loop of
%module instance creation. However, cycles of singleton imports are allowed.

%Subtyping is single inheritance, as in Java. This avoids ambiguous replace and
%merge inheritance order in a submodule.

%Merges cannot be done on singleton instances or modules accessed through a
%singleton instance. This is to make sure that other clients using the singleton
%instance are not affected by the change.

%As with merges, replace targets can not be a singleton instance or a module
%accessed through a singleton instance, for similar reasons. 

%Merges can only be done on submodules in the same path to the root module in
%the submodule tree. Furthermore, this should not change the module export signature
%of the module being submoduled. This is to guarantee that both internal and external
%clients of the module can still rely on their module qualified lookups.

%Exported packages in non-interface modules imply that there are classes that actually 
%belong to that package. Otherwise module interfaces become less useful.

%As mentioned, implementing a module interface means exporting the packages the interface
%exports. This is to ensure that the signature contract with the clients of
%the interface are satisfied.

%All references to an interface module must be replaced. Otherwise all lookups through 
%that reference will fail as the interface is empty.
